# Quick Guide: Recurring Bookings

## What is a Recurring Booking?

Book the same resource multiple times automatically - perfect for regular meetings, weekly study groups, or recurring events.

**Example:** Need a conference room every Monday night for your project team? Create one recurring booking instead of 12 individual ones!

## How to Create a Recurring Booking

### Step-by-Step

1. **Fill out booking form normally**
   - Choose resource
   - Set start date & time
   - Set end date & time
   - Add notes

2. **Check "Make this a recurring booking"**
   - Recurring options appear

3. **Choose your pattern:**
   - 📅 **Weekly** - Same day every week (e.g., every Monday)
   - 📅 **Bi-weekly** - Every 2 weeks
   - 📅 **Daily** - Every weekday (Mon-Fri)
   - 📅 **Monthly** - Same date each month

4. **Select end date**
   - When should it stop repeating?
   - Default: 3 months from start

5. **Review preview**
   - See how many bookings will be created
   - Confirm pattern is correct

6. **Submit**
   - All bookings created instantly
   - You'll see confirmation with total count

## Important: Admin Approval Required ⚠️

**All recurring bookings require admin approval** - even for resources that normally auto-approve single bookings.

This ensures:
- ✅ Fair resource distribution
- ✅ No long-term conflicts
- ✅ Proper oversight of repetitive usage

You'll be notified once approved!

## Conflict Detection 🔍

The system automatically checks each date for conflicts:

- ✅ **No conflict?** Booking created
- ❌ **Conflict found?** That date is skipped
- 📊 **You'll see:** "Created X bookings. Y dates skipped due to conflicts."

**Example:**
- Request: Every Tuesday 3-5 PM for 10 weeks
- Conflict: Nov 26 already booked 4-6 PM
- Result: 9 bookings created, Nov 26 skipped
